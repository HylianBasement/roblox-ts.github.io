title: npm publish errors with "npm error 402 Payment Required"
---

When publishing a package for the first time, you might encounter an error like this:

```sh
npm error code E402
npm error 402 Payment Required - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@rbxts%2fpackage - You must sign up for private packages
```

This happens because if you're publishing to a new package to an organization, it's private by default.
However, private packages require a paid npm org (which we don't have).

There are two ways to fix this issue:

### 1. `package.json` `publishConfig` setting

Add the following to your `package.json`.

```js
{
	"name": "@rbxts/package", // your package name goes here
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"publishConfig": {
		"access": "public"
	}
	// other fields
}
```

:::note
If you're using the [`npm init roblox-ts package` command](../guides/typescript-packages), this will be done for you automatically.
:::

### 2. `npm publish` CLI flag

```sh
npm publish --access public
```
