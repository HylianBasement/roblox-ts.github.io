title: npm publish errors with "npm error 404 Not Found"
---

When publishing a package for the first time, you might encounter an error like this:

```sh
npm error code E404
npm error 404 Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@rbxts%2package - Not found
npm error 404
npm error 404  '@rbxts/package@1.0.0' is not in this registry.
npm error 404
npm error 404 Note that you can also install from a
npm error 404 tarball, folder, http url, or git url.
```

This is due to a bug with our npm join-org page. We are working on a fix for this issue.

In the mean time, please reach out to Osyris on Discord with your npm username.
