:::note
This guide assumes you know how to use the command line. You can find tutorials on YouTube for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiTZgpRpWv0) or [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRYQsKR46I).

## Before You Begin

In order to start using roblox-ts, you'll need to have the following software already installed:
- [NodeJS 14+](https://nodejs.org/)
- A code editor. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Rojo 6+](https://rojo.space/). The easiest way to install it is through the [Rojo VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo).

## Project Setup

To start using roblox-ts to create a game project, follow these steps:

<!-- Unfortunately, we need to explicitly number these steps because there are images between them :( -->

1. Create a new folder and give it a name. The folder name cannot contain spaces. We are going to name ours `my-project`.

2. Open the folder using your code editor (or your command line if your code editor does not have one integrated).

3. Run `npm init roblox-ts` in your command line to start the interactive project setup.

:::caution PowerShell
If you're using PowerShell for the first time, you may get an error about "running scripts is disabled on this system". You can fix this by running the following in PowerShell as an administrator:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

4. Start roblox-ts in watch mode via `npx rbxtsc -w`. You can exit watch mode later by clicking on the command line and pressing `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard.

5. Next, start up a Rojo server. If you are using the Rojo VSCode extension, simply hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Rojo: Start Server`.

Otherwise, open a new terminal with the same working directory and start Rojo via `rojo serve`. In VSCode a new terminal can be opened by pressing the `+` button.

6. Open a new place in Roblox Studio where you wish to sync your compiled code into. Open up the Rojo plugin in Studio and hit `Connect`.

7. Write code! :tada:
